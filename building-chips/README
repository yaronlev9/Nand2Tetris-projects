Remarks
-------
*the Not chip uses a Nand gate that recieves the same input twice.
*the And chip uses 1 Nand gate and 1 Not gate.
*the Or chip uses 2 Not gates and 1 Nand gate.
*the Xor chip uses 4 nand gates.
*the Mux chip uses 1 Not gate and 3 Nand gates.
*the DMux chip uses 1 Nand gate 1 And gate and 1 Not gate.
*the Not16 chip uses the Not gate for every bit.
*the And16 chip uses the And chip for every bit.
*the Or16 chip uses the Or chip for every bit.
*the Mux16 chip uses the Mux chip for every bit.
*the Or8Way chip uses 7 Or chips that compares between all the 8 inputs
and chooses 1.
*the Mux4Way16 chip uses 3 Mux16 gates, the first 2 use the first bit of the sel
and the last Mux16 uses the second bit of the sel.
*the Mux8Way16 chip uses 2 Mux4Way16 for the first and second bits of the sel,
and the last Mux16 uses the third bit of the sel.
*the DMux4Way chip uses 3 DMux chips the first uses the second bit of the sel
and the other 2 use the first bit of the sel (opposite of what the Mux does).
*the DMux8Way chip uses the 2 DMux4Way and 1 DMux chips, the DMux uses the last
bit of the sel and the 2 DMux4Way uses the first and second bits of the sel.
