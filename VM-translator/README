Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
Main.py - The Main file that runs the program.
Parser.py - The Parser file that translates to asm.

Remarks
-------
*The Main file is build of 2 functions: the main function gets the vm file name
and calls the parse function, the parse function that creates the Parser object
reads all the lines translates them and writes them in a new asm file.
*The Parser has a constructor in which he gets the tables of all the commands and segments,
dictionary where the keys are the symbols and the values are the asm commands).

the read method goes over all the lines in the file cuts all the whitespaces and creates
a list of all the legitimate lines.

the vm_to_asm method checks first if the line is a push/pop command or an arithmetic command, or a label/function
command and then translates it to asm.

the is_valid_line checks if the line is a valid command in vm.

the write function goes over all asm lines and writes them in an asm file.
