Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
Main.py - The Main file that runs the program.
Parser.py - The Parser file that translates to ones and zero.

Remarks
-------
*The Main file is build of 2 functions: the main function gets the assembly file name
and calls the parse function, the parse function that creates the Parser object
reads all the lines translates them and writes them in a new hack file.
*The Parser has a constructor in which he gets the tables of all the labels and symbols,
the tables of the registers the jumps and the commands (dictionary where the keys are the
symbols and the values are the byte code value).

the read method goes over all the lines in the file cuts all the whitespaces and creates
a list of all the legitimate lines.

the asm_to_binary_line method checks first if the line is a A instruction or a C instruction,
an adds the bytes according to the tables.

the label_parse function goes over all the labels and adds them to the symbols table
with the value of the line they were created in. if the line refers to a variable
it gives it the value from 16.

the write function goes over all the byte code lines and writes them in a hack file.
