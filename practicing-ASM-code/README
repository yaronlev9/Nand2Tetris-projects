                           Project 4 - An ASM File
                           ----------------------- 
  

Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
Fill.asm - The Fill file.
Mult.asm - The Mult file.
Divide.asm - The Divide file.
Sort.asm - The Sort file.


Remarks
-------
*the Fill file checks if the keyboard is pressed if yes it blackens every pixel of the screen if ont it makes them
white.
*the Mult file gets 2 numbers and multiplies the result using a loop that runs the number of times of the second number
and sums every time the first number. if the second number is negative it deletes from the sum instead of addition.
*the Sort file  uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort from higher to lower in O(n^2).
*the Divide file does a O(logn) using shifting that divides the number by 2 each time and counts
the number of time it was divided until we get to a number that is the max without being higher than the original
number, then deletes it from him, and then goes again with the rest of the number until 0 is reached.
